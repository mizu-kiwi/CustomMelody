# OdinFabric CustomMelodyMessage Module

### This addon allows you to customize Melody Message based on OdinAddon for each progress stage.
but, I'm not sure if it will actually work since I'm under an unfair 30-day ban from Hypixel.

Developed for odin 0.1.4, it is compatible with the odin client. lol
I might update it if the Odin client gets updated. But it's shitty code, so it's just for my own satisfaction. Probably won't need maintenance.
